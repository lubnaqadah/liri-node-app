# liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


 liri can take in one of the following commands:

   * `my-tweets` to retreive tweets from twitter api

   * `spotify-this-song` + 'song name' to get all the information about this song

   * `movie-this` + 'movie name' to get all the information about this movie

   * `do-what-it-says` it will get the information about I Want it That Way song from spotify
